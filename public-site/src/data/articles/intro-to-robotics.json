They&#39;re used everywhere - from factories to hospitals, and even in our homes!</p>\n<h2>The Three Laws of Robotics</h2>\n<p>Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov created three famous laws for robots:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A robot may not harm a human being</li>\n<li>A robot must obey orders given by humans</li>\n<li>A robot must protect its own existence</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Parts of a Robot</h2>\n<p>Every robot has these basic components:</p>\n<h3>Sensors</h3>\n<p>Sensors are like a robot&#39;s eyes and ears. They help the robot understand what&#39;s happening around it. Common sensors include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Light sensors</strong> - detect brightness</li>\n<li><strong>Touch sensors</strong> - feel pressure</li>\n<li><strong>Ultrasonic sensors</strong> - measure distance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Controllers</h3>\n<p>The controller is the robot&#39;s brain. It&#39;s usually a small computer called a microcontroller. Popular choices include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arduino</li>\n<li>Raspberry Pi</li>\n<li>micro:bit</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Actuators</h3>\n<p>Actuators are the muscles that make the robot move. The most common types are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Motors (for spinning wheels)</li>\n<li>Servos (for precise movement)</li>\n<li>LEDs (for light output)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Building Your First Robot</h2>\n<p>Ready to build? Here&#39;s a simple project to get started:</p>\n<h3>Materials Needed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Arduino Uno</li>\n<li>2 DC motors</li>\n<li>1 Motor driver board</li>\n<li>1 Battery pack</li>\n<li>Wheels and chassis</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 1: Assemble the Chassis</h3>\n<p>Attach the motors to the chassis using the mounting screws. Make sure the wheels are aligned properly.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Connect the Electronics</h3>\n<p>Wire the motors to the motor driver, and connect the driver to your Arduino. Double-check all connections!</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Upload the Code</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">void setup() {\n  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Move forward\n  analogWrite(3, 200);\n  analogWrite(5, 200);\n  delay(1000);\n\n  // Stop\n  analogWrite(3, 0);\n  analogWrite(5, 0);\n  delay(500);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What&#39;s Next?</h2>\n<p>Congratulations on building your first robot! Here are some ideas to explore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add sensors to avoid obstacles</li>\n<li>Create a line-following robot</li>\n<li>Build a robot arm</li>\n<li>Program your robot to solve mazes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, the best way to learn robotics is by experimenting. Don&#39;t be afraid to try new things and make mistakes - that&#39;s how all great engineers learn!</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arduino.cc\">Arduino Official Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtube.com\">Robotics for Kids YouTube Channel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://firstinspires.org\">Local Robotics Clubs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Happy building!</p>\n"
