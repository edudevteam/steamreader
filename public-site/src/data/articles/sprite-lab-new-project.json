You will also learn how to use Settings, Version History, and the Show Code button. By the end, you will understand sprites, costumes, backgrounds, and how to run your app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-a-new-sprite-lab-project\">Create a New Sprite Lab Project</h3>\n<p>There are two ways to create a new Sprite Lab project.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the <code>Projects</code> link in the top navigation bar, then scroll down and click the <code>Sprite Lab</code> button.</li>\n<li>Find the <code>New project +</code> button in the top-right corner. Click it to open a drop-down menu, then select <code>Sprite Lab</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<figure>\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/84B7k5VDspc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"rename-project\">Rename Project</h3>\n<p>Always rename your project right away. Change <code>Untitled project</code> to something that describes what your project does. A good name helps you remember what the project is about, even weeks later. For example, if you have many projects, names like &quot;A, B, C&quot; or &quot;Silly Puppy&quot; make it hard to find the right one. Choose a clear name that helps you and others understand the project at a glance.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2c5Fc33dZuU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"breaking-down-the-app\">Breaking down the app</h3>\n<p>This tool is simple to navigate. You have three main areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Left: <code>Stage (Canvas)</code> - where your app runs</li>\n<li>Middle: <code>Blocks Toolbar</code> - where your code blocks are found</li>\n<li>Right: <code>Workspace</code> - where your app logic exists</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVH6maKMGbQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"adding-a-block-to-the-workspace\">Adding a Block to the Workspace</h3>\n<p>To make something appear on the Stage (Canvas), you need to drag a block from the <code>Blocks Toolbox</code> to the <code>Workspace</code>. For example, find the <code>set background to</code> block in the <code>World</code> section and drag it to the Workspace.</p>\n<p>If you drop the block by itself, nothing happens—it turns gray. You need to snap it under the <code>when run</code> block. The <code>when run</code> block tells your app: &quot;When the app starts, do these steps in order.&quot; Anything connected to this block runs once at the beginning.</p>\n<p>After you attach the <code>set background to</code> block, you will see the background appear on the Stage. Click the small down arrow on the block to see a list of backgrounds you can choose from. When you pick a different background, the Stage updates right away.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVDMkdF3TcE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"additional-buttons-and-settings\">Additional Buttons and Settings</h3>\n<p>Above the <code>Stage (Canvas)</code> are three buttons: Code, Costumes, and Backgrounds. Code is selected by default. Costumes and Backgrounds are tools for creating custom graphics. Use them to change existing sprites and backgrounds or create your own.</p>\n<p>Above the <code>Workspace</code> are three more buttons: Settings, Version History, and Show Code.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Settings</strong> lets you change the app&#39;s appearance to a different theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Version History</strong> lets you look at older versions of your project. If your current code is broken, you can go back to a version that still worked.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Code</strong> opens a window that shows your blocks as written JavaScript code. This helps you see what text-based code looks like. Keep in mind that you cannot simply copy and paste this code into another program and run it—there are extra steps involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2t-mx9cPAQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"find-and-open-a-saved-project\">Find and Open a saved project</h3>\n<p>If you need to stop working and come back later, don&#39;t worry—Sprite Lab saves your work automatically. To return to your home screen, click the <code>CODE</code> logo in the top-left corner. If you don&#39;t see your project on the home screen, click the <code>Projects</code> link in the navigation bar and scroll down. Find the project by the name you gave it and click to open it.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vT4qsxrhUcU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"share-your-app\">Share your app</h3>\n<p>When you finish your project, you can share it with others. At the top of the Sprite Lab window, find the <code>Share</code> button to the right of Rename. Click it to open a popup with a special link. Copy this link and send it to anyone you want to share your app with. The link opens your app in a player that looks like a mobile phone—it does not open the Sprite Lab editor.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VuF3RRSgFOk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n",
