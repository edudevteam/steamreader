## Sprite Lab Development Tool

In this guide, you will explore the Sprite Lab app. You will discover the Blocks Toolbox, Workspace, and Stage. You will also learn how to use Settings, Version History, and the Show Code button. By the end, you will understand sprites, costumes, backgrounds, and how to run your app.

### Create a New Sprite Lab Project

There are two ways to create a new Sprite Lab project.

1. Click the `Projects` link in the top navigation bar, then scroll down and click the `Sprite Lab` button.
2. Find the `New project +` button in the top-right corner. Click it to open a drop-down menu, then select `Sprite Lab`.

### Rename Project

Always rename your project right away. Change `Untitled project` to something that describes what your project does. A good name helps you remember what the project is about, even weeks later. For example, if you have many projects, names like "A, B, C" or "Silly Puppy" make it hard to find the right one. Choose a clear name that helps you and others understand the project at a glance.

### Breaking down the app

This tool is simple to navigate. You have three main areas:

- Left: `Stage (Canvas)` - where your app runs
- Middle: `Blocks Toolbar` - where your code blocks are found
- Right: `Workspace` - where your app logic exists

### Adding a Block to the Workspace

To make something appear on the Stage (Canvas), you need to drag a block from the `Blocks Toolbox` to the `Workspace`. For example, find the `set background to` block in the `World` section and drag it to the Workspace.

If you drop the block by itself, nothing happens—it turns gray. You need to snap it under the `when run` block. The `when run` block tells your app: "When the app starts, do these steps in order." Anything connected to this block runs once at the beginning.

After you attach the `set background to` block, you will see the background appear on the Stage. Click the small down arrow on the block to see a list of backgrounds you can choose from. When you pick a different background, the Stage updates right away.

### Additional Buttons and Settings

Above the `Stage (Canvas)` are three buttons: Code, Costumes, and Backgrounds. Code is selected by default. Costumes and Backgrounds are tools for creating custom graphics. Use them to change existing sprites and backgrounds or create your own.

Above the `Workspace` are three more buttons: Settings, Version History, and Show Code.

- **Settings** lets you change the app's appearance to a different theme.
- **Version History** lets you look at older versions of your project. If your current code is broken, you can go back to a version that still worked.
- **Show Code** opens a window that shows your blocks as written JavaScript code. This helps you see what text-based code looks like. Keep in mind that you cannot simply copy and paste this code into another program and run it—there are extra steps involved.

### Find and Open a saved project

If you need to stop working and come back later, don't worry—Sprite Lab saves your work automatically. To return to your home screen, click the `CODE` logo in the top-left corner. If you don't see your project on the home screen, click the `Projects` link in the navigation bar and scroll down. Find the project by the name you gave it and click to open it.

### Share your app

When you finish your project, you can share it with others. At the top of the Sprite Lab window, find the `Share` button to the right of Rename. Click it to open a popup with a special link. Copy this link and send it to anyone you want to share your app with. The link opens your app in a player that looks like a mobile phone—it does not open the Sprite Lab editor.
